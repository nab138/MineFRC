A simple papermc plugin to connect to an FRC robot/robot simulator and display the robot in minecraft.

For minecraft 1.21 (built for papermc, probably works for bukkit)

Usage:
- `/connect ntkey [ip] [port]` - Connects (default ip localhost) with the origin at your current location
- `/disconnect` - Disconnects
